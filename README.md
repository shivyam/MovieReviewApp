The Movie Review App is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for movies and post reviews. It is built using Java with Spring Boot for the back end, React.js for the front end, and PostgreSQL as the database. The application enables users to browse movie information, leave reviews, and interact with a clean, user-friendly interface.

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-review-app.git
   cd movie-review-app
   ```

2. **Install all packages and dependencies by running:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

In the project directory, you can run:

### Frontend

#### `npm start`

Runs the React front-end development server.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

### Backend
Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the movies-backend folder.

   ```bash
   cd movie-backend
   ```

Run the Spring Boot back-end server from your favorite Java IDE. This will start the API server on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Ensure your PostgreSQL database is configured correctly in the `application.properties` file.
